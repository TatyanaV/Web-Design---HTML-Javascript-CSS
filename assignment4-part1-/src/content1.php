		'PHP_SELF'
		The filename of the currently executing script, relative to the document root. For instance, 
		$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] in a script at the address http://example.com/foo/bar.php would be 
		/foo/bar.php. The __FILE__ constant contains the full path and filename of the current (i.e. included) file.
		If PHP is running as a command-line processor this variable contains the script name since PHP 4.3.0. Previously 
		it was not available.
		The idea is that I find the current location and seperate the parts by "/". 
		I would then go through the array and see if anything is there beyond the actual page I was on, 
		and if so, I could use it to find the current folder I am using and for other stuff*/
