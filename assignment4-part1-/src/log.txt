Tasks: finished everything. I had a lot of trouble with the following part of the assignment:
If a user tries to access either content1.php or content2.php without going through the login 
page at some previous point in time the user should should simply be redirected back to login.php.
I was able to access both of the links without logins. the issue is fixed
